      On Saturday, the day starts off at 8am with a Pancake Breakfast hosted by
      the volunteer fire department. The Arts &amp; Crafts Display, held in the
      Old Fire Hall next door, gives creative locals a chance to show their
      work. A special Errington Farmers Market begins at 10am with live music
      and lots of kids activities added to the usual mix of fresh veggies, home
      baking, cut flowers and crafts. Hi Neighbour Parade, refuted to be the
      world's shortest, starts at 12:30 and winds its way from the old
      elementary school site, around the corner and down the street to the Hall.
      Kids on decorated bikes, horses, ponies and imaginative floats - anything
      goes in this parade. After the parade, the adults adjourn to the hall to
      have a cold drink, watch the Talent Show and bid on the incredible
      bargains at the Goods &amp; Services Auction. The day winds up at 8pm with
      the Hi Neighbour Dance. Tickets for the Dance are $20 and will be sold at
      Errington General Store, Cranky Dog in Parksville or Heaven on Earth in
      Qualicum.
