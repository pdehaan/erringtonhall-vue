        <p>
          It is with heavy hearts, that we have to report the passing of a
          long-time Errington resident and member of the Hall Association,
          <strong>David Malek</strong>. He contracted double pneumonia in April
          and was hospitalized. In spite of his fighting spirit, and best
          medical efforts, with lungs compromised by a child hood bought with
          polio, he succumbed on May 9, 2017. He had served as President, Vice
          President and Hall board member for many years, beginning in the early
          1980's. Always an advocate for the disabled, he was the driving force
          behind the construction of the Universal Access Ramp now the entrance
          to the Hall, which he officially opened on Hi Neighbour day in 2013.
          Another visible legacy of his effort is the Community Stage, which
          hosts live music every summer Saturday at the Farmers Market in the
          Park. Indeed, David was a board member in 1993 and heavily involved in
          the process of re-building the Market in its new location. David had
          been, since its genesis, a part of our annual vaudeville show 'A Night
          at the Palace' as a producer, musician, singer, actor and master of
          ceremonies. He was a also a master of disguise - appearing in many
          imaginative get-ups on our annual Pumpkin Trail or Halloween Dances.
          Our deepest sympathies go out to his partner, children, family and the
          hundreds of people, from Errington and beyond who knew and loved him.
          It is hard to imagine the Hall and Errington without David. David, you
          will be greatly missed. Thanks for the memories.
